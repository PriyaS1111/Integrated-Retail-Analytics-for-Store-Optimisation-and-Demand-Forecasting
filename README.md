# Integrated-Retail-Analytics-for-Store-Optimisation-and-Demand-Forecasting
Developed an ML framework for retail analytics to forecast demand, segment stores, &amp; detect anomalies. A Random Forest model accurately predicts weekly sales (R  2  =0.81). K-Means clustered 45 stores into 3 tiers for targeted strategies. This suite of tools provides actionable insights to boost efficiency, reduce costs, &amp; drive growth.
This project, "Integrated Retail Analytics for Store Optimization and Demand Forecasting," provides an end-to-end machine learning framework for a large retail company. The primary objective was to move beyond traditional analysis and leverage advanced data science techniques to generate actionable, strategic insights. By analyzing historical sales data in conjunction with store characteristics and external economic factors, this project successfully delivered a suite of tools to forecast demand, segment stores, identify sales anomalies, and uncover cross-selling opportunities.

The project began with a thorough data wrangling and exploratory data analysis (EDA) phase. Three distinct datasets—sales, features, and stores—were merged into a single, cohesive master dataset. Key data cleaning steps included imputing missing values in markdown and economic data using logical fill methods and converting date columns to a usable format. The EDA, involving over 15 visualizations, revealed critical insights: sales are heavily influenced by strong seasonal patterns (with major peaks in Q4), store size, and store type, while external factors like fuel price and temperature showed a weaker correlation.

Following the EDA, a multi-faceted modeling approach was undertaken to address the project's core components:

Customer Segmentation: Using K-Means Clustering, the 45 stores were successfully segmented into three distinct performance tiers (High, Mid, and Low). This was validated with a strong Silhouette Score of 0.55, providing a clear framework for tailoring marketing and operational strategies.

Anomaly Detection: An Isolation Forest model was implemented to automatically flag unusual sales records. This serves as a powerful monitoring tool to identify potential data errors, operational issues, or highly successful local promotions that warrant further investigation.

Demand Forecasting: The main predictive component was a Random Forest Regressor, which was trained to forecast weekly sales. The final model proved to be robust, achieving an R² score of 0.81. This indicates that the model can explain 81% of the variability in sales, making it a reliable tool for optimizing inventory, staffing, and financial planning. The feature importance analysis confirmed that department, store size, and seasonality were the most significant predictive factors.

Market Basket Analysis: A high-level analysis using sales correlation as a proxy was performed to identify departments with strong purchasing associations. This generated an actionable list of department pairs, providing a data-driven basis for optimizing store layouts and creating cross-promotional campaigns.

Throughout the project, insights were statistically validated using hypothesis testing, confirming the significance of findings from the visualization phase. The final deliverables include a suite of well-documented, implemented models and a clear set of strategic recommendations. This project successfully transforms raw data into a powerful asset for data-driven decision-making, enabling the company to enhance efficiency, reduce costs, and drive revenue growth.
